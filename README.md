# ReactJS - Generate PDF from Form Inputs

I have created a demo form which accept Name as an input and a dropdown where the user can select the stream i.e. M Tech or B Tech. And once the user clicks on Submit a PDF gets generated which is to be saved on the local machine.

This PDF is saved by the stream name, and it contains details like the Name, Course name, Date and Fee structure.

For generating the PDF I have used [jspdf-autotable] package (https://www.npmjs.com/package/jspdf-autotable). You may visit this site and check out for more details in terms of additional configuration.

Download the zip or clone the repo on your local and run npm install to install latest dependencies and run npm run dev to see it on the browser.
